What is AWS?
Since early 2006, AWS has provided companies of all sizes an information technology services platform in the cloud. With AWS, software developers can easily requisition compute, storage, database, and other Internet-based services to power their applications. Developers have the flexibility to choose any development platform or programming environment that makes sense for the problems they’re trying to solve. Since developers only pay for what they use, with no upfront capital costs and low operating costs, AWS is the most cost-effective way to deliver computational resources, stored data, and other applications to end users.

Benefits of AWS
AWS benefits hundreds of thousands of customers in China and around the globe with a secure, reliable, and scalable information technology services platform.
no-upfront-investment
No Upfront Investment
Building on-premises information technology services can be slow and expensive. There is costly hardware and software that needs to be ordered, paid for, installed and configured and all of this needs to happen long before it is needed. With AWS, developers and businesses don’t have to spend time and money on these activities; instead they can simply pay for the resources they consume, when they need it, on a variable basis.
low-ongoing-cost
Low Ongoing Cost
AWS helps reduce overall IT costs in multiple ways. Our economies of scale and ongoing efficiency improvements allow us to continually lower prices. Our multiple pricing models allow customers to optimize costs for both variable and stable workloads. Additionally, AWS drives down upfront and ongoing IT labor costs and gives customers access to a highly distributed, full-featured platform at a fraction of the cost of traditional IT alternatives.
flexible-capacity
Flexible Capacity
Predicting how users are going to adopt a new application is difficult. When developers make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, they often end up with either idle expensive resources or limited capacity, which can result in a poor end user experience until resource constraints are resolved. With AWS, this problem goes away. Developers can provision the amount of resources they need, when they need it. If they need more, they can easily scale up. If they don’t need them, they just turn them off and stop paying.
speed-agility
Speed & Agility
With traditional information technology services, it can take weeks to get resources procured, delivered, and running. These long timelines stifle innovation. With AWS, developers can deploy hundreds or even thousands of compute nodes in minutes, without having to talk to anyone. This self-service environment changes how quickly developers can create and deploy applications and allows software development teams to innovate more quickly and more frequently.
apps-not-ops
Apps not Ops
AWS lets customers shift resources away from data center investments and operations and move them to innovative new projects. Scarce IT and engineering resources can be focused on projects that grow the business instead of on IT infrastructure that is important but which rarely differentiates a business.
global-reach
Global Reach
Whether an AWS customer is a large global company or a small start-up, it may have potential end users around the world. With traditional alternatives, it’s hard to deliver great performance to a broadly distributed user base, and most companies focus on one geographic region to save money and time. With AWS, the game changes - developers can easily deploy applications to reach end users in multiple geographies using the same AWS technologies operating in different locations around the world.
