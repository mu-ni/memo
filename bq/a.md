curious about how it works
already worked in BJ 4 years, It's time to try sth more challenging
Because I wanna improve myself and try to satisfied more customers' requirements

3. How about the OA
not too difficult for me
because I am used to keep learning
join the weekly contest every week
Usually I can finish the top 3 problems in half an hour, they are midium or easy level
for the last problem hard level, it depends, sometimes can but sometimes can not

* Amazon culture
