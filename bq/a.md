12. biggest failure
    spent almost 2 weeks to fix a very simple bug
    parse parquet file content, anxious
    terrible situation is when I fixed this bug, another new bug will appear
    a very simple bug lead out a series of new bugs, and they happened again and again
    first reason is, not familiar with patquet, familar before starting
    main reason is, no complete UT
    make sure the bugs already be fixed will not appear again
    Original functions are still work well
