1. Why amazon?
    * the culture of Amazon attracts me a lot
    * many talented engineers are working here

2. Why this position in Vancouver?
first job - learn how to develop in production not just demo, how to cooperate with others
currenr job - learn how machine learning works and how distributed system works
next - try sth more challenging, improve myself and try my best to satisfied more customers' requirements


* Amazon culture
Our Leadership Principles empower us to
be owners and innovators
while maintaining our customer centricity.
We’re willing to take risks – innovating requires failing.


1. Why Amazon
2. List three strengths
My daily work is well planned, I never make myself very busy when deadline is approaching
Willing to innovate, try new technologies, propose new ideas to solve problems(i18n)
willing to share knowledge with others and learn from others
I still keep learning every day.
I don't want to waste time, At least, I should make myself a litter better/improvement than yesterday.


3. A piece of critical feedback I received from the others
Good partner at work. I often come up with new ideas

I have a lot of novel ideas, maybe not workable, but I'd like to share with others
As Female engineer, I pay more attention to details than others, Easier to find Hard-to-detect bugs

4. A time working on a project and the results exceeded the goals
Current project, from scratch
innovation project, 50% failed. But luckily, we succeed.
Help our data scientist and deliver team -> reduce time to deliver
use same code(SQL) for batch-compute and realtime-compute

5. Sometimes when teammates are not "qualified"
I don't think anyone is not qualified, just because this task is not suitable for him
I think it is necessary to make someone familiar with code/workflow firstly, not just coding but don't understand the code's background.
Everyone has his own  strengths and weak points

6. Obstacles met during a project
customer they don't want to upgrade version, but wanna use new version's features
I really understand their situation, but it is hard for us to maintain 2 versions of the same product
Gray test
if the new version
until they fully trust our new system works well



requirements from data scientist and deliver team
conflict between them
more functions for better model effect & as simple as possible to learn quickly
they are both correct
pareto principle, focus on the 20% of main requirements
trade off
impossible perfect product at the beginning, should keep iterating


My task is depends on others, I have to wait for them before they finish their task
But after they finish their task, I don't have enough time to develop and test


some years ago. I haven't realized the importance of testing.(united tests)
the result is, when I fix a but and merge the PR, another bug will be found soon
At that moment, it is hard to fix a bug without introduce new bugs
It is the biggest lesson I've learned during my previous work.
After that, no matter how urgent the deadline is, I must write unit tests before the PR
I will never allow this to happen again

7. What I want to improve most
hard to refuse others, hard to say no. It takes a lot of my personal time after work
sometimes their requirements may beyond my work scope
For example, I already provide the complete document for them, but it seems they don't want to read our docs at all
They just want me to help them hand by hand, it waste me a lot of time
make work-life balance

The STAR technique is a common system used to answer behavioral interview questions. It provides a structure for you to remember so that you include the correct data in your answers.

These are the 4 steps:

S – Situation - background info

T – Task - what you had to do

A – Activity - what you did - this should be the longest part of the answer

R – Results - positive; quantifiable; what you learned; what you would do differently next time

1. Tell me a challenge you had where the best way forward was not clear cut. How did you decide what to do?
that is exactly my current project
I started my current project one year ago from scratch
notice that it is hard for deliver team to deliver a model to customer smoothly
pyspark - java, cost at least one week for development, with many errors
We want to develop a system that make model on production without any modification
we schedule some workshops for sharing our ideas with data scientist and collect opinions from them
Keep constraints - can not develop a product perfectly at the first version - keep iteration

2. Give me an example of something you tried to accomplish but failed.
not only support our colleague, but attract more developers anywhere in the world
we want to make a standard for AI application development workflow
Last quarter, We planed to attract at least 100 developers to use our system
But, you know, we have to support our internal delivery team firstly,
and we don't have enough energy to promote and operate our product
it is a pity, we hope that we can do it this year

3. Give me an example of a time when you showed initiative.


4. Give me an example of a time when you motivated others.

5. Tell me about a time when you delegated a project effectively.

6. Tell me about a time when you coached someone.
We have one fresh-out colleague in our team,

7. When have you used your fact finding skills to solve a problem?


1. "Who was your most difficult customer?"
2. "How would you introduce AWS in an elevator pitch?"
3. "What is the worst mistake you ever made?"
UT
4. "If your direct manager was instructing you to do something you disagreed with, how would you handle it?"
I will discuss with him firstly before I staring to do
Normally both of us are correct, Just because we have different points of view
It is normal that people have disagreements
the most important thing is listen carefully to his opinions and share my opinions with him
Because our goals are the same, and I am sure we will reach an agreement on at least one point
We should start from this point and try to reach the final agreement


5. "Describe what Human Resource means to you."


6. "What is the angle between the hour hand and minute hand in an analog clock?"

7. "How do you detect whether or not a word is a palindrome?"

8. "Do you know our CEO? How do you pronounce his name?"  - Jeff Bezos
9. "Here's a string with numbers from 1-250 in random order, but it's missing one number. How will you find the missed number?"
bucket sort

10. "Are you willing to work on your feet for ten hours, four days a week?"
Yes I'd like to have a try
Our society is developing, I think we should open for any kind of working mode
work-life balance

11. "Do you think you'll reach a point where you storm off the floor and never return?"

12. "Would you tell on a employee for stealing?"
13. "How would you solve problems if you were from Mars?"
14. "How do you persuade说服 people?"
15. "Describe what happens in your browser as soon as you hit enter after writing a URL in the address bar."


16. "Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone."
17. "Walk me through how Amazon Kindle books would be priced."

18. "What would you do if you saw someone being unsafe at work?"
19. "What would you do if somehow you misdirected 10,000 units of something?"

20. "How would you improve Amazon's website?"
21. "You have 30 people working under you with 2 working indirect. Each employee can do 150 units/hour. Each work day has two 15 min breaks and one 30 min lunch. In a 5 day work week, how many total units can you complete?"
22. "What is the most difficult situation you have ever faced in your life? How did you handle it?"
23. "How would you tell a customer what Wi-Fi is?"
24. "You are Amazon and Samsung offers you 10,000 Samsung Galaxy S3s at a 34% discount. Is that a good deal?"
25. "Design an online payment system."
26. "Give me an example of a time when you were 75% of the way through a project, and you had to pivot strategy--how were you able to make that into a success story?"
27. "Should we sell private label cleaning products?"
28. "What would you do if you found out that your closest friend at work was stealing?"
29. "Which Amazon leadership principle do you resonate most with?"

Why Amazon?
Amazon is a top internet retailing company with a strong focus on customer experience and obsession. Its motto- work hard, have fun, make history, and it’s vision, earth’s most customer centric company, inspires me. I’m a person who respect hard working and care a lot about customer experience, so the culture of Amazon attracts me a lot. Furthermore, the growth of this company is pretty impressive, it’s not only an online retail shop but also has a wide range of products like Alexa, Kindle, fire tablet and TV, Amazon cloud service, etc. Hundreds of thousands of talented engineers are working passionately here, building innovative system and solving problems at unprecedented scale. Therefore, this is a place where I can learn a lot, and use my skills and experience to make things happen with a team.

Why choose this position?
The job I have applied is the software development position in Amazon Books, I am interested in this position because:  
First of all, Amazon Books uses innovative technology to merge physical and online worlds into one unique and delightful shopping experience. The concept is really cool and pioneering. I am really excited about learning and using new technologies to create new exceptional experiences that firmly obsess customers.
Secondly, I’d like to work with solutions from a full-stack point of view, by engaging with requirements, frontend, middle tier, backend, storage, and all the other stuff, I can understand problems and solutions thoroughly, and thus scale and optimize them with the best practices.
Thirdly, I’m happy to work in an environment with a lot of challenges so that I’ll never be boring. In Amazon, I can take ownership of the projects I am truly passionate about. I am sure I can take the challenges and provide successful solutions.

Introduce yourself
- My name is X. I’ve been working on software design and development related work for past two years. My experience includes communicating and analyzing user requirements, authoring functional requirement documentation and workflows, building wireframes and interactive prototypes, and then helping implement web applications within a team. The web applications I helped design and develop all meet to user needs very well and also have great user experiences and elegant UIs. The modules and features I’ve developed includes document metadata and status management, news tag prediction and recommendation, online collaborative coding platform, etc. I’m especially passionate about working on solutions from a full-stack standpoint, because by understanding user requirements as well as overall system architecture thoroughly, I can deliver products with both great performance and easy-to-use experience. I am also happy to learn new technologies and incorporate them with what I’ve been doing. Keeping learning and being curious always refreshes my mind with better designs and solutions.


The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it?  (earn trust, customer obsession)
The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I took on and led a project for the first time. I got a requirement from the client about updating parts of a certain workflow. So I documented the requirements, worked on them with the team, and released the update to the demo system on time, however, the client tried and didn’t like it.
We diagnosed the feedback and system immediately, It turned out that we paid a lot of attention on the changes the client requested us to do, but didn’t do much evaluation on other features that are impacted by the change.
I apologized to the client immediately and asked if we could have an extended deliver date. Luckily the client agreed and also showed understanding. Then I called a meeting with all the team members, talked about the feedback, then we walked through the whole workflow step by step together, evaluated all the possible operations that user might take on each step and then tailored the change we were gonna make accordingly. Throughout this process, the team members understood what happened, why the client was not happy, and they also brought up a lot of good opinions. Instead of just telling the team to make changes again, I earned their trust by sharing the feedback with them and working out a solution together.
We then released a tentative version to the demo system before the deadline, walked through it with the client and collected feedback provided. Finally, we delivered the update to the production successfully, our client was very happy and used it every day without any trouble yet.


Most challenging project?
The most challenging project I’ve done was an online collaborative coding platform, it’s like Leetcode but with collaborative feature. The most challenging part was to incorporate collaborative features with the code editor, that is, user in a same coding room can see the real-time cursor movements and typing actions of the other users.
It was challenging because I was supposed to come up with the solution and implement it by myself, and I have never developed something like this before.
So I started with composing a visual solution first, the work I’ve done included researching online collaborative products, listing core features I needed, building wireframes, and designing UI. With the visual solution, I had a good understanding on how the application would work. Then, I googled and read a lot of system design solutions for products with similar features, like Google doc, online chatting room, etc. With what I’ve read, I was able to draft out my own solutions and selected corresponding technologies.
I implemented it successfully within the given time, and my solution received a positive feedback because it is not only working well, but also visually pleasing. Throughout this process, I learned that it is important to be curious and keep learning, try to read as many technical blogs or articles as you can, the more you read, the better you’ll ace a problem or design. The feeling of ownership is very important, some other students just gave up with the excuse “I don’t how to do it"

Couldn’t finish tasks before deadline?
deliver result, ownership


CUSTOMER OBSESSION: Walk us through a time when you helped a customer through a difficult process and what that looked like.
leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
case 1
Last year in Telamon, I took on and led a project of developing a web application for our Telecom engineering team, in order to help engineers build and manage detail specifications easily for their Telecom installation jobs. The detail specification building process was sort of complex, involving a lot of data entry and field data collection, and the requirement documentation provided to us was brief and totally in text description.
Therefore, it is challenging for me to come up with an intuitive and engineer-friendly design.
In order to understand the process thoroughly, I made several appointments with the engineering team, going through the specification building process with them step by step in detail. Then, I did some field observations, looking at how engineers use their ipads and computers in the field and in the office, when and how they input the data to complete a detail specification. Based on what I’ve learned and observed, I was able to come up with data schemas, draft a working prototype, and bring it to the engineers to collect feedback.
It turned out that the prototype was very helpful, it saved us around 10% time when implementing the web application. After the production was released, the engineers tried and loved it immediately. They said they took less time building a specification now  with less error. The customer was obsessed with our professional process and result, and start to have more business with us.
case 2  (customer obsession and ownership, highest standard)
In Telamon, once I led the team to implement an AP processing service for one of our client - Hubert Corporation. We provide a customized AP processing system as well as a team of AP clerks to help Hubert process their invoices. Since invoices from different vendors might require different ways of processing and our client didn’t have a full instruction for that (they usually process invoices based on their knowledge and familiarity), we had to spend time emailing back and forth dicussing about instructions whenever there was a special invoice processed incorrectly.
I looked at the invoices reported and thought we could do better in managing different invoices, vendors and corresponding instructions, and thus reducing the communication effort put by the client and us.
I first created a shared matrix and recorded all the invoices and instructions provided, and asked our AP clerks to update it as long as there was any new invoice feedback from the client. Then based on the analysis of the matrix, I created a checklist listing certain type of error-prone invoices and asked our AP quality managers to check on these type of invoices every day. Further, I programed and applied notifications for several type of invoices with special instructions in the system, so that our AP clerks didn’t have to watch out for them all the time.
After several weeks of running the service, I scheduled a meeting with the client and reviewed the matrix with them, they were impressed by it. And they even used the matrix as the instructions on their side. After a month or two, we barely got any email about incorrectly processed invoices from the client. We obsessed our client with our great quality and attitude to insist on the highest standards.


OWNERSHIP: Give me a example of when you took a risk and it failed.
leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “That’s not my job”.
case 1
I’d like to talk about one of my project at BitTiger. BitTiger had a bootcamp course for project managers and I was hired as the lead developer to help implement the idea driven by the project managers teamed with me.
Our task was to improve BitTiger's current communication channels between teachers and students, and integrate them more with its official web portal.
Since I was the person who was going to lead another developer to build the product, it was important for me to understand the user needs and the decisions made by the project manager thoroughly. The best way to do so was to actively take part in the decision making process from the very beginning. Therefore, for most of the activities hosted by the project managers, I asked to join them, like, taking notes while the project managers were interviewing with teachers and students, coming up with suggestions while they were discussing about user personas and stories, offering help while they were building wireframes, and joining discussion when they were creating and prioritizing tasks.
I was able to implement the product quickly because I totally understood what the project managers wanted. We didn't need to spend time communicating the requirements again. With the time saved, I was able to add more customized features making the product easier to use. On the demo day, we had a great presentation and received very good reviews.
case 2
the communication feature is not easy to use, only remind the client you received a new message and log in. The client didn't log in to the system very often. Sometimes the client just email back to me saying what happened.
I took the ownership to support this project, I designed a new process by delivering the content to the kitchen designer and bring it to the client to discuss. the client agreed. After deliver, our customer support team has reduced around 70% support request for this project.


INVENT AND SIMPLIFY: Tell me a time when you created an innovative product.
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
case 1
question board, BitTiger need to manager a lot of things, like notification, link to the live course, questions, communication. We are overwhelmed at the first about inventing the process, thinking about a lot of ideas like group by different tabs, create with different categories. But I decided to keep it simple and stupid, we create the post for all purpose, but group it by weeks. All important notification on the top.
care more about look and feel rather than a lot of features
case 2
The project we did for hartson kennedy was to help process their drawing and purchase order. The customers  usually order countertops in their stores and kitchen designers then doing the drawings and generate PO paperwork, and send to us. However, the kitchen designer only uses fax machine, but we didn't have fax machine.
Instead of just purchasing a fax machine and assigning a person to handle the scanning everyday, I googled and did a research online first. I found a service that can receive the fax via email. I created a distribution list and registered it as the receiving mailbox.
With the simplified process, we don’t have spend money and time dealing with fax machine and scanning.  I invented and simplified the fax receiving process and saved money for our company.



ARE RIGHT, A LOT: Tell me about a time when you observed two business opportunities to improve ROI, and how did you determine that they were connected.
Leaders are right a lot, they have strong judgment and  good instincts. They seek diverse perspective and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
tell me about a time when you are wrong
tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information
make a decision, but also consider the opinions of the other people
case 1
we have a indexing team in china that helps enter the data on the invoice, I designed the indexing panel for them. Before making the decision, I decided to talk to the staff who are doing the data entry. Ask them to try and record the time and provide feedback. It turned out that they have some very good point of view, like amount match, required text-box color. And I changed my design and improve 10% processing time.
case 2
once I argue with the manager about issue the corporate email, I want to register emails from MS and Gmail for business use because Telamon email sometimes blocks, and we have to contact Telamon IT which are not very responsible. The manager disagree at first, he said the corporate email is more professional. I collected the issue happened, and the impact on the client, feedback from them, average time IT reach and solve the problem, it turned out that we cannot bare it. then the manager agrees to switch as long as we can get a good domain name. We then applied a domain based on coporate and the name of our department. Everyone is happy.



LEARN AND BE CURIOUS: How do you find the time to stay inspired, acquire new knowledge, innovate in your work?
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act on explore them.
case 1
I recently learned how Redux architecture and how it work
actions, global status, dispatch actions
case 2
how large company deploy their front-end
how to cache


HIRE AND DEVELOP THE BEST: Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a poor performer on your team.
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their in coaching others. We work on behalf of out people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
case 1
for the data entry team in China, they didn’t care much about the system before. When I led the project, I will  invite them to join the meeting, tell them I we develop the system, teach them how to test and ask them to feel free to give me feedback if they any idea. they are the direct users of the system.
finally these employees are very helpful for testing new features, and improve the efficiency of the indexing.
case 2
When I transferring the projects from one person to another, I will co-work with them for a while, making sure the things they completely get the idea.


INSIST ON THE HIGHEST STANDARDS: Tell me about a time when you could have stopped working but persisted.
Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
case 1
hubert three way matching features, we have implemented the feature successfully. But I found the processor took long time to compare the amount of receipt, Purchase order, and invoice, calculate the tolerant percentage, identify any mismatches. I took the initiative to add exception handling features, instead of finding mismatches by eyes, I add a box to input and compare the amounts by the program.
it turned out the efficiency has improved a lot.
case 2
client give us the ftp, and overwrite data everyday, sometimes if there is holiday, we may miss one or two load. I write a program to fetch the file and archive the data by date, so that we’ll always have the backup if there is any issue happened.
http://www.codejava.net/java-se/networking/ftp/java-ftp-file-download-tutorial-and-example


THINK BIG: Tell me about a time when you proposed a new business.
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
case 1
augmented reality to find store
case 2
ambient building


BIAS FOR ACTION: Describe how you would handle a busy situation where three people are waiting for help from you.
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.
case 1
the other engineer and I discussed for a couple hours, figured out what we disagreed on, and I suggested that neither answer was necessarily better. She agreed. I said that unless she had any new info, I’d rather we just pick mine, and we could always come back to the decision later if we learned something new.
example??
case 2



FRUGALITY: Tell me about a time where you thought of a clever new way to save money for the company.
dd
case 1
for most of internal tools, we’ll google first instead of developing by ourself.
case 2
USL, this project is a little hurry, we don’t have enough resources for that. Average of processing one load takes around 4.5min, and we watch all the steps, automatically whatever we can, and reduce the process time to 2 min finally.


EARN TRUST: Tell me a time when you earned trust of a group.
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body order smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
vocally self critical
The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I took on and led a project for the first time by myself. I got a requirement from the client about updating parts of a certain workflow. I listed the requirements, developed with the team, and released the update to the demo system on time, however, the client tried and didn’t like it.
I diagnosed the system immediately, It turned out that we paid a lot of attention on the changes the client requested us to do, but didn’t do much evaluation on other features that are impacted by the change. A solid evaluation and design was necessary in this case because all the features in the workflow were closely connected to each other, and even a small change might cause butterfly effect.
I apologized to the client immediately and asked if we could have an extended deliver date. Luckily the client agreed and also showed understanding. Then I called a meeting with the dev team, walked through the whole workflow step by step together, evaluated all the possible operations that user might take on each step and then tailored the change we were gonna make accordingly. We then released a tentative version to the demo system before the deadline , walked through it with the client, and collected any feedback provided.
Finally, we delivered the update to the production successfully, our client was very happy and used it every day without any trouble yet.

DIVE DEEP: Tell me about a time when you had to dive deep into the data and the results you achieved.
trust but verify
you believe the person but check the facts anyway
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task beneath them.
case



HAVE BACKBONE, DISAGREE AND COMMIT : Tell me about the most difficult interaction you had at work.
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
disagree with boss?
If I have different idea with my manager or boss, I will try to collect data or make a prototype trying to convince him. If I have tried my best and he still disagree, then I would respect his decision and start committing for that.
when we released the service for US Logistics. The client complaint that some invoices were missed. I checked around and found that Telamon Network blocked some of the emails sent by the client. I talked the problem to the network administrator and they couldn’t change the email restrictions due to the policy.
Therefore, I brought this problem up to my manager and suggested to register another business mailbox provided by gmail or microsoft. The manager disagreed at first because he thought it was unprofessional if we didn’t use our own corporate email domain. I thought solving this problem was more important because our client would lose the trust on the quality of our data. In order to convince him, I showed him the data of email missing rate and the impacts on our client, and also I registered a good domain name composed by our company and department name, so we could still be professional on that part.
Finally, the manager was convinced and agreed on my suggestion. We barely have any missed emails after we switched our mailbox. And because of the good result, we started to use the domain for other projects gradually.


DELIVER RESULTS: Tell me about a time where you overcame an obstacle and delivered results.
leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
what you’d do after you realized you couldn’t hit the date?
First, I’d check every possible way that could possibly make me hit the date, like using after-work time, weekends, or holidays, asking for help or suggestions, finding alternatives or simpler solutions, etc. Since I am the owner of the tasks, it’s my responsibility to deliver results on time. It’s my fault that I underestimated the workload when I took the tasks.
There was one time that we couldn’t finish the troubleshooting of a bug on time, the system should have sent out auto emails at 7:00 am but sometimes it failed. Before solving the problem, I will check each morning and manually trigger emails to the client.
If I still couldn’t hit the date, I would look at features, pick out a few with highest priority that I could finish, and then discuss about the problem with the project manager. Of course, I would apologize first and then try to discuss about the best solution to minimize the impacts. Once the project manager agrees, I would notify all the people that could be impacted by the delay.

Behavior Question呢，实际上就是除了Technical Question之外的所有跟面试官的交流内容内容~按照 http://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-105717-1-1.html 中提到的，跟面试官的交流基本上算是跟Technical Question同等重要的事情，所以特地开帖来跟想要准备这个方面的同学们分享一下经验和想法~

本文包含以下内容：
- 自我介绍. check 1point3acres for more.
- 关于Project
- why this role in this company in this specific area
- 关于冲突和teamwork
- 问面试官问题

其实这个文章并不是号召说让大家纯纯粹粹背答案，而是在准备了答案的基础上稍微有一些变通的能力。当然话说回来能想到的问题还是写一写大概理理思路比较好。

在开始讨论问题之前呢，有一个问题需要考虑一下，就是面试官expect一个怎么样的人。但是不要说谎，不要随便站道德制高点（我每周工作80小时没关系的！之类）。。。因为太假了……
这个问题的答案其实不难：专业领域上水平够，然后good team player，对工作对公司有热情，对文化对模式有认同感的人。

专业领域水平够体现在：CS背景够强：有一两个能被demonstrate能力的编程语言，从事相关工作和经历。
good team player体现在：有疑问多沟通，有矛盾善于解决，以team利益为先，敢于承担责任敢于优化流程。
对公司对工作，还有对文化模式的热情体现在：整个人对面试的良好准备，还有就是问面试官的问题，还有整个面试的精神面貌和态度上。

基于以上的assumption，回答问题的思路在于，简介阐明答案然后把答案拐回以上的assumption里，同时有针对性的否认可能会引起歧义的理解方式。

举 个简单的歪楼的例子，比如说你喜欢的姑娘问你【今天肚子有点不舒服啊，怎么办呢。】广为诟病的一个答案就是【多喝点儿热水。】为什么被诟病，就是因为这个回答太简单，让人觉得很敷衍，根本不上心。如果是面对喜欢的姑娘，你想跟她传达你对她的关心的话，答案应该是这样子的：【多喝点儿热水吧，我网上查了一下 你这个情况感觉是xxxx了然后热水会有用（表明contribution，回避不上心这个歧义的理解方式）。还有你是不是吃了冷的东西了，如果肚子不舒服的话要吃点养胃的，我给你送来吧blala。】或者是【你是不是不舒服来我给你讲个笑话转移一下注意力吧，你这样子我看着也不开心啊（直接的传达关心）】这样就好很多。为什么要第一次回答的时候就规避会引起歧义的理解方式呢：比如说【多喝点儿热水】之后，姑娘觉得你根本不关心她，就不会想跟你聊了==这个概念先入为主后面就难以挽回了，因为后面的解释都像是掩饰。。。


自我介绍

I am XXX from XXXX, majored in XXX.这是第一句。（如果不是CS的话呢，这后面要加一句你现在在做的CS的相关的东西。还有提一下Myprimary programming language is XXX） I am concentrated on XXXX and I have experience in XXX./I am solid in XXX（这一句是technical的强势方向，一般如果说的是project的话强调相关性，不然就说一说你会的语言啊，XXXX experience之类比较以广度取胜的东西）. I am interested in XXXX inyour companry.  基本上就是这个格式。如果是转专业的人的话要加一句为什么你想要转CS，一个比较常用的模式就是i found my interest when I am doing XXX差不多是这样吧~重点是简短！当然对于一些强势相关方向一定要提，比如说做过的app之于iOS开发，后面可以加一句提一下下载量什么的。

举个例子：
I am Emmon who is a graduate student from Gatech ECE. My concentration is Computer Engineering and I am solid in C/C++/Obj-C.（※第一句因为专业不是CS让人以为你的CS背景差，第二句以学习方向和熟练的语言两点来挽回一下背景的相关度）I am now working with some friends to develop an iOS application which was in App Store this May and downloaded for 5k times.（第二句强调强势方向，workingon 一个受众不小的app） I am interestedin your mobile development role and I will graduate next May.（说明来意）

基本上就能涵盖所有的东西了。


关于Project

其实关于project呢，一般就是这几个点：这个东西用干嘛的，用什么写的，难点在哪儿（因为一般都是most challenge啊或者memorable），怎么克服（跟前一点一定配套出现），（如果是多人的项目）你的个人贡献是什么。
关 于干嘛的这个点务必画图还有举例子，这点特别重要，当然如果不幸在电面里面被问到，那就请务必把fancy的那些收起来用它的用处来概括这个东西。这个其 实跟写简历的思路很像。这是什么，这能做什么，输入是什么，输出是什么，人们用来干什么。
I developed a media player system on Pic 32（什么东西——mediaplayer）. It is written in C and the difficult part isthe integration part since there are a lot of modules working together. To conquer it I read a lot of media player source code and talk with my TA andtried for many times（这里透露了三个点：自主学习能力，向合适的的人寻求帮助还有实验精神）and finally finish it. When I heard the music playing I am so proud of it. 适当的supporting details可以加一点点，一句话左右。
一个常见的challenge是“totally new to it”,不过这个的克服是个很容易被challenge的东西。比如说如果你能问人，能找到资料，也有很多例子可以模仿的话，那就根本不算是challenge，毕竟大家都有要接触新东西的机会。所以呢，difficult part可以细化为“没有人问”，“没有人做过”，“很少外部资料”然后加上why，然后再说用其他两条途径克服的，这样子就可以合理避免被challenge。
The challenge part of my project is that I am totally new to it meanwhilefew people in our team have experience in it since it is a XXXX team. Toconquer it, I tried to find some similar implementation online and blabla这个感觉。



Why thiscompany/this role?

别提钱，别假大空。这两条一定要避免。
一个比较讨巧的方法是说你喜欢这个公司的产品，同时就是喜欢这个公司的特有的一些培训和policy：比如说fb的bootcamp。还有就是朋友在这里工作说这里很好= =（实在想不出来说什么的话可以用这个）。关于changethe world之类真的要慎重。。。面试官也不傻。我个人觉得从自身出发的话会比较引共鸣一些，而不是“这个公司伟大”。这个区别很微妙，而且其实很多是同一个点就看你怎么表达。比如说apple，你不能说因为iPhone市场占有率大你想work on it但是你可以说你是apple fan很喜欢它的操作什么的，然后想workon it。主观色彩蛮好的。
关于为什么这个职位呢，我个人觉得可以从你做CS的事情的时候的主观感受来说。你可以说“我做过我觉得很喜欢，因为可以学新东西/做完之后很强的成就感”之类，记得一定加一句since或者后面接一句detail比如“when I finally see 它怎么样怎么样工作，I felt a strong sense of success”。转专业的人一定要有点相关的经验的重要性就体现在这儿，你总不能说因为CS好找工作还有赚钱多吧（虽然我知道这是true fact）但是面试的时候真的不能这么说……
既然有比较的话其实自己的本行为什么不行也需要考虑一下。不能叫苦叫累，但是你可以说又苦又累还学不到新东西/不能make impact/想试试别的东西，差不多就是这个路子了。这个【但是】很重要哟~

关于冲突和teamwork

这个问题的答案很能体现我们国人的中庸之道。不能轻易说别人错显得你推诿，不能不说别人错显得你怂还有盲从；不能一味听别人显得你不独立思考，不能一味不听别人显得你独；不能随便指出别人错了显得你莽撞而且你的疑问可能阻碍项目进展，不能看着别人错（这个很好理解吧）。所以呢，要中庸，显示的你考虑周到。
以下这几条立场请揣摩一下：
-      大家的想法都是为了把事情做完做好，所以从这个角度上来说没有矛盾是不可调节的
-      无关第一条的事情都可以回避，私人恩怨放一边
-      不轻易质疑别人，除非你有足够strong的support，你不能说跟你想的不一样的就是错的，需要一些相对客观的依据
-      多跟别人交流，接上一条，如果大家都觉得你想法没问题，那么你该指出
-      作为一个team goal为primary concern的，任何有助于这个的事情都能做，任何无关于这个的都可以放一边
基于以上立场，很多问题的答案其实就昭然若揭了 ：）

问面试官问题

其实这一部分可以很随意，不过主要就是一条：show passion
可以问的问题可以是：
-      如何上手（on boarding process)
-      dailylife
-      日常上班干什么
-      the thing u like best about this company
-      next step
诸如此类的。。反正显得你很感兴趣很想来就行了~这一句是大立场，因为我见过有轮coding有个人做出来了还给了一个no hire的分数是因为那个candidate完全看不出来想来。。很没精神的样子……而且不怎么搭理人。。。


剩下的tips: 多笑，多生动的举例子，尊重面试官，make assumption的时候多用问句，然后多问问面试官【我打算XXXX这样说可以吗】。大概就是这个feel。
