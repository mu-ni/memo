1. Why amazon?
    * the culture of Amazon attracts me a lot(be owners and innovators, willing to take risks)
    * many talented engineers are working here
    * a small decision will affect a huge amount of customers, very attractive for every engineer

2. Why this position in Vancouver/why this role in this company in this specific area
// first job - learn how to develop in production not just demo, how to cooperate with others
// currenr job - learn how machine learning works and how distributed system works
interested in AWS - PAAS, used aws(Amazon S3 - Simple Storage Service) in my previous project
developer friendly API, stable service, easy to maintain and monitor
curious about how it works
already worked in BJ 4 years, It's time to try sth more challenging
Because I wanna improve myself and try to satisfied more customers' requirements
When my friend told me this hiring event, I immediately decided to participate and complete the OA the next day


3. How about the OA
not too difficult for me
because I am used to keep learning
join the weekly contest every week
Usually I can finish the top 3 problems in half an hour, they are midium or easy level
for the last problem hard level, it depends, sometimes can but sometimes can not

* Amazon culture
Our Leadership Principles empower us to
be owners and innovators
while maintaining our customer centricity.
We’re willing to take risks – innovating requires failing.


2. List three strengths
- My daily work is well planned, todo list, I never make myself very busy at the last minute of deadline
- willing to share knowledge with others and learn from others. In my current company, build engineer culture
  organized some workshop in my team, For example, I have shared spring-boot, curator,
- Willing to learn new technologies, propose novel ideas to solve problems, maybe not workable
- As Female engineer, I pay more attention to details than others, Easier to find Hard-to-detect bugs
class loading sequence in classpath, maven dependency tree


6. Obstacles met during a project
customer they don't want to upgrade version, but wanna use new version's features
I really understand their situation, but it is hard for us to maintain 2 versions of the same product
Gray test
if the new version
until they fully trust our new system works well

- Introduce yourself, introduce projects(难点，克服，个人贡献)


requirements from data scientist and deliver team
conflict between them
more functions for better model effect & as simple as possible to learn quickly
they are both correct
pareto principle, focus on the 20% of main requirements
trade off
impossible perfect product at the beginning, should keep iterating


My task is depends on others, I have to wait for them before they finish their task
But after they finish their task, I don't have enough time to develop and test


some years ago. I haven't realized the importance of testing.(united tests)
the result is, when I fix a but and merge the PR, another bug will be found soon
At that moment, it is hard to fix a bug without introduce new bugs
It is the biggest lesson I've learned during my previous work.
After that, no matter how urgent the deadline is, I must write unit tests before the PR
I will never allow this to happen again

7. What I want to improve most
hard to refuse others, hard to say no
For example, I already provide the complete document for them, but it seems they don't want to read our docs at all
They just want me to help them hand by hand, it took me a lot of time
make work-life balance
