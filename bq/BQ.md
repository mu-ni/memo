Leadership Principles
We use our Leadership Principles every day, whether we're discussing ideas for new projects or deciding on the best approach to solving a problem. It is just one of the things that makes Amazon peculiar.

1. Customer Obsession（顾客至上，从客户角度出发获取信任，关注竞争者，但是更关心客户）
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
- Walk us through a time when you helped a customer through a difficult progress
- Who was your most difficult customer?
- Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
- When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs？

2. Ownership（目光长远，不为短期结果牺牲长期价值，从不说”那不是我的工作”）
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."
- Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished.
- Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.
  teamwork

- Tell me a challenge you had where the best way forward was not clear cut. How did you decide what to do?
- Give me an example of something you tried to accomplish/took a risk but failed
- Tell me about a time when you took a calculated risk.
- Give me an example of a time when you showed initiative.

3. Invent and Simplify（创新的发明，寻找简化方法。从任何地方寻找新的想法。在做新的事情时，可以接受一段时间内存在误解）
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
- Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.
- Tell me about a time when you invented something
- Tell me a time when you created an innovative product
- Most challenging project?

4. Are Right, A Lot（领导者有更强的判断力和直觉，接受不同的观点）
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
- tell me about a time when you are wrong
- tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information
- Tell me about a time where you overcame an obstacle and delivered results.
- Obstacles met during a project


5. Learn and Be Curious（保持学习，提升自己，对新事物好奇，乐于探索）
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
- How do you find the time to stay inspired, acquire new knowledge, innovate in your work?


6. //Hire and Develop the Best（善于发现人才，指导他人）
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
- Tell me about a time when you mentored/coached someone.
- Sometimes when teammates are not "qualified"
- Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a poor performer on your team.
- Give me an example of a time when you motivated others.激发灵感，激发动力

7. Insist on the Highest Standards（坚持最高标准，交付高质量产品）
Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
- Tell me about a time when you could have stopped working but persisted.
- Tell me about a time when you couldn’t meet your own expectations on a project.
- Tell me about a time when a team member didn’t meet your expectations on a project.
  progress or quality?

8. Think Big（大胆思考，激发成果）
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
- Tell me about a time when you proposed a new business.
- Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.
- Tell me about a time when you went way beyond the scope of the project and delivered.

9. Bias for Action（速度至关重要，决定和行动有时可逆，做好风险评估）
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.
- Describe how you would handle a busy situation where three people are waiting for help from you.
- Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.
- Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?


10. //Frugality（争取事半功倍）
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.
- Tell me about a time where you thought of a clever new way to save money for the company.
- Tell me about a time when you delegated a project effectively.

11. Earn Trust（获取信任，乐于倾听，尊重他人，多从自身找原因）
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
- Tell me a time when you earned trust of a group.

12. Dive Deep（关注细节，及时review，及早发现）
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.
- Tell me about a time when you had to dive deep into the data and the results you achieved.
- A time working on a project and the results exceeded the goals
- Give me two examples of when you did more than what was required in any job experience.


13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit（敢于挑战权威，敢于对自己的决策负责）
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
- Tell me about the most difficult interaction互动 you had at work.
- Tell me about a time when you did not accept the status quo现状.
- Tell me about a time when you had to step up and disagree with a team members approach.
- If your direct manager was instructing you to do something you disagreed with, how would you handle it？

14. Deliver Results（按时交付高质量产品，遇到挫折挺身而出，对产品有追求，不满足于现状）
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
- What is the most difficult situation you have ever faced in your life? How did you handle it?
- By providing an example, tell me when you have had to handle a variety of assignments任务. Describe the results.
