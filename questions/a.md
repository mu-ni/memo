So I have been a back-end engineer since 4 years ago
And I would like to look for a back-end engineer position in Paris

So I decided to look for a new job in paris

As this position in for Luckey,
So I wanna know what is the relationship between Luckey and Airbnb currently/in the future?
Luckey is operated independently? Or it will be totally merged with Airbnb?
