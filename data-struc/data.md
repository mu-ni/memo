arrays, hashtables, breadth/depth first search

After initial tasks usually comes questions how you can parrallel this or do the same for much larger data input.
Many questions about knowing the framework and main language features for checking depth of knowledge or what has changed for the last N years.

I applied online. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Criteo (Grenoble (France)) in March 2017.

- always keep talking, explaining what you…
